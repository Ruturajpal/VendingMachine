# Vending Machine Program in Java

## Design and Reasoning
This Java program simulates a vending machine with the specified features. It includes a `VendingMachine` class that manages the inventory, float of coins, and allows users to buy products. The design focuses on simplicity, and error handling and edge cases are not fully addressed for brevity.

## Instructions
1. Run the program by executing the `main` method in the `VendingMachine` class.
2. Follow the program output to observe the changes in inventory and purchasing.

## Program Usage
- The program initializes with a default inventory and float.
- You can update the inventory and float using the provided methods.
- Display the current inventory with `displayInventory()`.
- Purchase products using `buyProduct(productName, quantity, coinsInserted)`.
- The program calculates change if applicable.

## Note
This is a simplified implementation, and additional error handling and features can be added for a complete solution.
